# RMS (Rapid Messaging System)
Free-to-use private messaging system. Inspired by RCS, made for everyone.

RMS is a free messaging system that is open for anyone to use, customize, or change. While we have the backend code all set up, you worry about the frontend! There is plenty of documentation to help you get started on using RMS.

## Getting Started

Head over to https://rms.coopr.tech/docs to get started. From there, you'll have your messaging app ready in no time.

This GitHub repository is mainly only used for the pre-made client (which can be changed, but is ridiculously hard, so we recommend making your own)
